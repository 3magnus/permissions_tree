# permissions_tree
Drupal 7 module to display site permissions in an alternate way: grouped by role, like a tree and loading just enabled ones.

Installation
------------
Install it like any other module: place its folder in your sites/all/modules folder and enable it
on the modules page.

Issues
------
Styles of inner fieldsets (including legends and divs) are NOT finalized for |Bartik|.
Using |Seven| everything looks as it should.
